If you have a Google account, you can code with Colab without downloading any IDE (Integrated Development Environment) or installing any packages onto your local machine.\n",
    "<br></br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Colab Notebooks are functionally very similar to Jupyter Notebooks (with a few exceptions for uploading/downloading to/from local files) while also having similar funcitonalities to Google Docs/Sheets/Slides where you can collaborate with group members in real time and comment on blocks of code/text.\n",

This requires the filename you input to be a file already in existence in the cpu of the remote server you are using. This means that you will have to write the file before downloading it to your own machine. How to write a file depends on the filetype. An example for a csv file is as follows:\n",
